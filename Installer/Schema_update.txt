This update process assumes that the installation target has already had the PostgreSQL application,
ODBC driver, and any other system components required by the database installed.  This would include
installation of an earlier version of the database with its earlier version of the schema.  This
updater WILL NOT install the complete database schema!

If the changes to be applied to the schema contain incompatibilities in data type conversions (e.g. float to integer)
the schema MUST be recreated fully and any contained data erased.  Full schema installation is handled by the full
database schema installer batch process, contained in a separate installer batch script.  That script is 
available through the <backend-repository-root>\Installer folder and will bnot be detailed here.


update scenario: PostgreSQL already installed, and an instrument database containing data which needs
		 to be preserved is already installed but obsolete;

	1) Copy the 'SchemaUpdater.bat' file from the HawkeyteApplicationSource\Installer repository folder
	   to a known location on the target system for later execution.
	2) Copy the 'AlterSchema.sql' file from the HawkeyteApplicationSource\Installer repository folder
	   to the same location on the target system as the updater script.
	3) Open an administrative command prompt and change to the location of the updater batch and sql files.
	4) Run the 'SchemaUpdater.bat' file.  It is configured to check for the presence of an existing
	   instrument database and configure usernames and passwords appropriately. Under some circumstances
	   it MAY prompt for the username to be used (BCIViCellAdmin is recommended), and once entered will
	   prompt for the password for that user when required.
	   
			- ALTERNATIVELY, the copy of the updater script can be modified to replace the PGUSER and PGPASSWORD
			  environment variable 'set' statements with the name and password to be used during the database
			  schema creation (again, this should be BCIViCellAdmin).

			- NEVER modify the SchemaUpdater.bat file in the repository folder if making custom mods for your
			  particular installation scenario.  Make a working copy of the file in a different working folder!

	The AlterSchema.sql script run by the SchemaUpdater.bat script adds those elements to the schema which were
	not present in the last released database schema.  If the updater has been previously applied, error may be
	noted during sql script processing relating to the elements previously updated in the schema.  While these
	errors should be noted and examined, it is highly likely that they are not significant.
