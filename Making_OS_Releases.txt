The same OS image is used by both the Scout and Hunter instruments.  The motherboard for both instruments
is the same, as are the base drivers and tools needed.

Avoid if possible any changes that are specific to one instrument.  These specific changes should go into
the application installer, if possible.

DO NOT make modification which are mutually exclusive between the instrument models.  This will REQUIRE
a separate part number for the OS needed by each instrument, and associated BOM changes if these types
of changes are needed!


1) Attach a hard drive to a Hawkeye motherboard. NOTE that the contents of the hard drive will be completely overwritten!

2) Using Clonezilla (or the image tool currently used), install the previous image onto a hard drive.

3) Update any drivers or OS configurations that need to be changed on the newly imaged drive.
   This would include changes to the ProService tool or to the version of McAfee white-listing tool, as well
   as camera or LED engine drivers.

4) Update the OS release version indicator file in the '\Instrument' folder.
   The file name is 'version'.txt (e.g. "ViCell-OS-v0.6.txt"), and the single-line content of the file
   is the version descriptor (e.g. 'ViCell OS version 0.6').

5) Ensure the instrument appliation loader batch files are present in the '\Instrument' folder:

        LoadViCell_Installer.bat
        find_installer.bat

6) Using Clonezilla (or the image tool currently used), Create an image of the updated drive.  Naming convention
   would be ViCell-Base-OS-Image-vX.Y-yyyy-mm-dd-img.
