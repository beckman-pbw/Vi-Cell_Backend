// stdafx.h: This is a passthrough for the precompiled header file to include standard system include files,
// or project specific include files that are used frequently, but are changed infrequently.
//
// When using pre-compiled headers, files listed below and any include files referenced by them) are compiled
// only once, improving build performance for future builds.
//
// This also affects IntelliSense performance, including code completion and many code browsing features.
// However, files listed here are ALL re-compiled if any one of them is updated between builds.
//
// Do not add files here that you will be updating frequently as this negates the performance advantage.

// if not using pre-compiled headers, remove any defines related to pre-compiled headers that may have been placed in the file (#ifndef PCH_H; #define PCH_H; #endif // PCH_H)
