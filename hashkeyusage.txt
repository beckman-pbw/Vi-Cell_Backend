The output of the generator produces an xml file containing the filename tested and the hask key attributes for that file.
The utility can remove the path to the target file from the information included in the xml file.  That is the condition used
currently, so that the target file may be checked regardless of the location by moving to the target file location.

See the FcivReadMe.txt file for supported modes and options.

Here are the usage conditions currently employed for the key generator:

create:
fciv.exe -add <path-to-target-file>\<target-file-name> -wp -both -xml <path-to-target-file>\hash.xml
: after generating the has keys, list them from the key file...
fciv.exe -list -both -xml <path-to-target-file>\hash.xml > <path-to-target-file>\hash.txt

verify: this command structure assumes the file name is read from the xml file containing the has key information:
fciv.exe -v -both -xml <path-to-target-file>\hash.xml
