    CONSOLE APPLICATION : FT2232H EEPROM Modify Project Overview
========================================================================

AppWizard has created this FT2232H EEPROM Modify application for you.

This file contains a summary of what you will find in each of the files that
make up your FT2232H EEPROM Modify application.


FT2232H EEPROM Modify.vcxproj
    This is the main project file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard.
    It contains information about the version of Visual C++ that generated the file, and
    information about the platforms, configurations, and project features selected with the
    Application Wizard.

FT2232H EEPROM Modify.vcxproj.filters
    This is the filters file for VC++ projects generated using an Application Wizard. 
    It contains information about the association between the files in your project 
    and the filters. This association is used in the IDE to show grouping of files with
    similar extensions under a specific node (for e.g. ".cpp" files are associated with the
    "Source Files" filter).

FT2232H EEPROM Modify.cpp
    This is the main application source file.

/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named FT2232H EEPROM Modify.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" comments to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
